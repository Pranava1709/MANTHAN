# ADVANCED OBJECT DETECTION IN IMAGES AND VIDEOS

This repository contains code and WEBSITE of the implementaion of the idea proposed.
Brief Description : This system takes images or videos as an input from the user. Two main sub-systems that are deployed on the website are DEHAZING and DENOISING, and with each system YOLOV5 Detection model is integrated. Depending on the requirements user can choose his sub-system and results will be dehazed or denoised image with the detected label and on the video approach we have integrated frame extraction and the user gets each frame dehazed or denoised with the detected label.
